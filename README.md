# EasyAPI README

## Features

- Uses a custom backend to scrape data and generate results. Anyone looking for an API to use can use this extension to look up
  APIs related to a category.

- After installing the extension, try Command+Shift+P (Mac) or Control+Shift+P (Windows) to use the extension.

- Type "Get API List" to start the extension. An Input bar will show up. Choose the category you want to look for.

- A new file "APIlist.json" will be created that will include the different APIs that can be found under that category. You can also change the file name by entering the name in the input box that pops up. Example: "Business, business" would make a file named business.json and have information about Business related APIs in it.

- Type the command again and choose a different category to get other APIs.

- The document would include the name, description and website of the API so that anyone looking for help can read more about the API.

- A JSON parser extension is recommended to view the information properly.

- The extension allows people to look fore more than 1000 APIs!
